       <h2>Introduction:</h2> 
       <p>
         Sonic the Hedgehog is a video game character that focuses on the aspect of platforming and building speed a formula that was simple enough to catch many people's attention. Sega (The company that created Sonic) trying to go against one particular company mascot has created a game that will forever impact gaming history from now on and what's to come. Sonic the Hedgehog is a fast if not the fastest thing alive in his world, Sonic also has friends he holds dear such as Tails his fox best friend/brother, Knuckles his rival, Amy Rose, etc. Sonic came down a path that is to be remembered by all as one game turned into more, people started making comics, and most recently has gotten on the big screen all because of one game.</p>

       <h2>Backstory:</h2>
Before we got the character we know and love today Sega wasn’t always Sega. Starting in 1940 as Standard Games,  going to Service Games Of Japan in 1950 they were mainly in the business of arcade games. This became popular and ended up lasting until 1970 when they were finally known as Sega. In the early 1800s, since the arcade business was showing fewer results of people using them, they decided to create their home consoles, “starting with the SG-1000 and Master System” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Sega) unfortunately their systems didn’t flourish like other companies did, leading a downhill representation of their consoles things started to get better. As Nintendo’s mascot Mario was introduced and helped their console sell more, Sega released their mascot Sonic the Hedgehog. With Sonic their home consoles started getting the attention of the people and at the same time went up against Mario eventually beating him in the consoles being sold. Ever since that mark in history, Sonic games began to take off, he’s gotten friends that are known to everyone today, and there have been great games to follow his success. Even though Sonic was a great sensation to the public without Nintendo’s Mario Sega wouldn’t have anything to go against and strive to do better.
Now for more prominent details after our character was born Sonic’s story in his games has mostly remained the same. In Sonic 1, 2, CD, and 3+knuckles ( the classic area of his life) Sonic the Hedgehog must stop the villainous Dr. Ivo Robotnik (referred to as Eggman in later games) from turning his animal friends into robots, as well as collecting these mystical gems known to us as chaos emeralds which hold major power by getting to them first. This is the major plot for most Sonic games however adding more for the player as we evolve from game to game. Sonic 1: collectibles were the chaos emeralds (it’s not a main objective you just get the good ending once you do collect them all), Sonic 2: introduces your sidekick Miles “Tails” Prower a two-tailed fox that at his young age still has major IQ up his belt, the emeralds are still present as collectibles, however, the reward for collecting them all grants you a form known as Super Sonic, Sonics super form allows faster speeds and invincibility from enemies although death can still be guaranteed from being crushed and falling off into the void. Sonic CD: Addition of a damsel in distress Amy Rose, Sonic now has to fight the robotic version of himself whilst trying to stop Robotnik from obtaining the Time stones off of Little Planet. Sonic 3 and Knuckles:
